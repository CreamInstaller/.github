## 🎮 Introduction
Welcome to **CreamInstaller**. Using it, you can add pirated DLC’s to your legal game for free + always automatically get the latest version.

## ✨ How to Use
Once you have installed DLC Unlocker, follow these steps to start using it:
1. Start the program executable. *Read above under Installation if it doesn't launch.*
2. Choose which programs and/or games the program should scan for DLC. *The program automatically gathers all installed games from Steam, Epic and Ubisoft directories.*
3. Wait for the program to download and install SteamCMD (if you chose a Steam game). *Very fast, depends on internet speed.*
4. Wait for the program to gather and cache the chosen games' information & DLCs. *May take a good amount of time on the first run, depends on how many games you chose and how many DLCs they have.*
5. **CAREFULLY** select which games' DLCs you wish to unlock. *Obviously none of the DLC unlockers are tested for every single game!*
6. Choose whether or not to install with Koaloader, and if so then also pick the proxy DLL to use. *If the default version.dll doesn't work, then see [here](https://forum.ubden.com.tr/konu/creaminstaller-auto-dlc-unlocker-installer-config-gen.1602/#google_vignette) to find one that does.*
7. Click the **Generate and Install** button.
8. Click the **OK** button to close the program.
9. If any of the DLC unlockers cause problems with any of the games you installed them on, simply go back to step 5 and select what games you wish you **revert** changes to, and instead click the **Uninstall** button this time.
